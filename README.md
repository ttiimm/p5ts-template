# p5ts-template

A minimal template for creating one off p5.js sketches written in TypeScript.

## Acknowledgment

The project structure is based off of the one described in this blog post: [How to use p5.js with TypeScript and webpack](https://dev.to/tendonnman/how-to-use-p5js-with-typescript-and-webpack-57ae) by [H](https://dev.to/tendonnman). 

## Usage

1. Install npm on your system. 
2. Start a repository using this template and clone it.
3. Install dependencies `$ npm install`.
3. Run `$ npm run start`. The default browser should open with the sketch.
5. Modify `src/index.ts` and webpack will keep the sketch updated.
